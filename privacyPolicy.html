    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Appto's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our services.</p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do soâ€”for example, to provide our services, to communicate with you, or to make our services better.</p>

    <h2>Information we share</h2>
    <p>We do not share personal information with third-parties nor do we store information we collect about your use of our services for use other than to improve our services.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The Appto app requires the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to your device's location: This permission allows us to provide you with property listings and services based on your current location. It also helps facilitate the task of creating and setting property addresses accurately.</li>
        <li>Access to your device's camera: We use this permission to enable users to capture and upload photos of properties instantly. This enhances the user experience and allows for better representation of properties within the app.</li>
        <li>Access to your device's external storage: This permission enables the app to fetch files stored on your device, such as property documents or photos, making it easier to create and update property listings directly from your phone.</li>
        <li>Internet access: The app requires internet access to fetch property listings published by other users, allow you to publish your own properties, retrieve photos and location information, and update personal information securely.</li>
        <!-- Add more permissions if needed -->
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
